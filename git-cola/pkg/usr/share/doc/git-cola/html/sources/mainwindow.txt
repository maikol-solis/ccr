Keyboard Shortcuts
==================
`git cola` has many useful keyboard shortcuts.

Learn about them by either pressing the ``?`` key,
choosing ``Help -> Keyboard shortcuts`` from the main menu,
or by consulting the
`git cola keyboard shortcuts reference <../hotkeys.html>`_.

Drag and Drop `git am`
======================
Dragging and dropping patches onto the `git cola` interface
applies patches using
`git am <http://schacon.github.com/git/git-am.html>`_.

You can drag either a set of patches or a directory containing patches.
All files are sorted alphanumerically before being applied.
This means that patches named ``0001-foo.patch`` are applied
before ``0002-bar.patch``.

When a directory is dropped `git cola` walks the directory
tree in search of patches.  `git cola` sorts the list of
patches after they have all been found.  This allows you
to control the order in which patchs are applied by placing
patchsets into alphanumerically-sorted directories.

Custom GUI Layouts
==================
`git cola` remembers modifications to the layout and arrangement
of tools within the `git cola` interface.  Changes are saved
and restored at application shutdown/startup.

`git cola` can be configured to not save custom layouts--
simply uncheck the `Save Window Settings` option in the
`git cola` preferences.
